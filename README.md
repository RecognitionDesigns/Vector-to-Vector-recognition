# Vector-to-Vector-recognition
This script allows Vector to recognise another Vector using machine learning

This is still a work in progress so may not get expected results.

You will have to create your own model trained on images of Vector as my model filesize is too big to upload.

Follow the guide here on how to train your custom model.
